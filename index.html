<h2>Speeding isn't Worth the Risk</h2>
<p>When your in the drivers seat it's tempting to go faster. You tell yourself "I'll enjoy this"
  or "I'm going to make up for lost time". The reality is speeding is one of the drangerous and costly 
  decisions while driving. It increases the risk of accidents, doesn't save significant time, spends more
  money on gas, and wears down your vehicle.

<h3>Speed into Accidents</h3>
<p>According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), 
  speeding was a factor in nearly 29% of all traffic fatalities in 2021, 
  killing more than 12,000 people <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/speeding"> (NHTSA, 2023).</a> 
  The dangers are real, and yet, drivers speed every single day.</p>
    <p>A clear danger of speeding is the increased chance of hitting something: another car, object in the road, 
      going off the road, or a pedestrian. The fact is at higher speeds requires further distance to stop. </p>
      <ul><li>
        30 mph takes ~110 feet to stop
      </li>
    <li>
        60 mph takes ~240 feet to stop
      </li></ul>
      <p> Now you why speeding is among the top causes of car crashes, worldwide.</p>

      <h3>Faster Saves Little TIme</h3>
      <p>We all believe speeding can get us to our desistination faster. Studies show its marginal.</p>

      <figcaption> A study conducted by the U.S. Army </figcaption>
    </figure>
      <ul><li>Going from 35pmh to 45pmh saves 5.71 minuets</li>
        <li>From 50pmh to 60mph saves less, 3 minuets</li>
         <li> 65mph to 75pm 
         saves even less, only 1.85 minuets. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>With traffic lightes and slow downs, those minuets reduce to seconds. Are seconds <strong>worth</strong> the risk of 
          tickets, accidents, or worse?

          <h3>Burning Money</h3>
          <p>The U.S. Department of Energy explains that gas mileage decreases above 50 mph. The fast lane is the expensive lane. 
            Slowing down is the "The Zone", saves fule, money, and the environment. 
            <ul>
              <li>Every 5 mph over 50, costs $0.20 per gallon.

    <h3>Visting the Shop</h3>
    <p>Your car gets a beating from speeding. Tires wear out quicker spinning at higher speeds and 
      generating more heat. Brakes degrade faster as they need to work harder to stop. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Tire lifespan reduced by 25% - $50-$180. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Brake repair - $200-$700
      </li>
      <li>
        Shorter supension lifespan
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the long run, speeding doesn't help you, it takes you the car shop sooner than later.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Speeding is not your friend. A friend doesnt cause accidents, waste your time and money, 
      or damage your vehicle. Consider a habit of driving in the safe zone - for the purpose of driving, 
     which is to get somewhere.</p>
